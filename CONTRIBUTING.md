## Adding a New Project

If you want to add a new project under Labs:

1. Create a new directory under `projects/`
2. Include a `README.md` with:
   - Project description
   - Goal / problem it solves
   - Maintainer(s)
   - Current status (idea / prototype / active / archived)
3. Keep projects lightweight and focused
4. Hackathon and experimental projects are welcome

Not all projects are expected to be long-lived — learning is a valid outcome.
