# Governance

LibreMinds Labs follows a lightweight, community-first governance model.

The goal of this governance is to enable collaboration, learning, and experimentation while ensuring a respectful and sustainable community.

---

## Roles

### Contributors
Anyone who contributes code, documentation, ideas, reviews, or feedback is a contributor.

Contributors are encouraged to participate in discussions, submit pull requests, and help others learn.

---

### Maintainers
- Each project under LibreMinds Labs should have at least one maintainer.
- Maintainers are volunteers from the community.
- Maintainers are responsible for:
  - Reviewing and merging contributions
  - Guiding the project direction
  - Ensuring basic project hygiene (README, license alignment, responsiveness)

---

### LibreMinds Stewards
- LibreMinds stewards act as neutral facilitators for the repository as a whole.
- Their role is to:
  - Uphold community values
  - Ensure inclusivity and fairness
  - Help resolve conflicts if they arise

Stewards do not override maintainers except as a last resort.

---

## Decision Making

- Decisions should be made openly through discussion and consensus whenever possible.
- If consensus cannot be reached, the project maintainer(s) make the final decision.
- For cross-project or community-wide concerns, LibreMinds stewards may facilitate resolution.

---

## Project Lifecycle

Projects in LibreMinds Labs may be:

- Experimental or hackathon-based
- Actively maintained
- Inactive and archived
- Graduated to a standalone repository under the LibreMinds organization

Graduation decisions are based on maturity, sustained interest, and maintainer readiness — not on strict checklists.

---

## Ownership and Stewardship

LibreMinds Labs is community-owned.

LibreMinds acts as a steward of the codebase on behalf of the community.  
Stewardship may be transferred in the future to a non-profit or similar neutral entity while continuing to honor the original open-source license.
