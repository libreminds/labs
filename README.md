# LibreMinds Labs

LibreMinds Labs is a community-driven playground for experimentation, learning, and collaboration.

This repository hosts early-stage tools, proof-of-concepts, hackathon projects, and exploratory ideas contributed by the LibreMinds community. Labs is intentionally low-barrier and inclusive — a place to try ideas, learn in public, and build together.

Not all projects in Labs are expected to be long-lived. Learning, experimentation, and sharing are valid outcomes.
