# LibreMinds Labs

LibreMinds Labs is a community-driven playground for experimentation, learning, and collaboration.

This repository hosts early-stage tools, proof-of-concepts, hackathon projects, and exploratory ideas contributed by the LibreMinds community. Labs is intentionally low-barrier and inclusive — a place to try ideas, learn in public, and build together.

Projects in Labs may evolve, be archived, or graduate into their own standalone repositories under the LibreMinds organization.

# Governance

LibreMinds Labs follows a community-first, lightweight governance model.

## Maintainers
- Each project under Labs should have at least one maintainer.
- Maintainers are responsible for reviewing contributions, guiding the project, and ensuring basic project hygiene.
- Maintainers are volunteers from the community.

## Stewards
- The LibreMinds organization stewards this repository to ensure:
  - A welcoming and inclusive environment
  - Alignment with LibreMinds values
  - Resolution of conflicts if needed

## Decision Making
- Decisions are made through open discussion and consensus where possible.
- In case consensus cannot be reached, project maintainers make the final call.
- LibreMinds stewards may intervene only as a last resort.

## Project Lifecycle
Projects in Labs may be:
- Experimental and short-lived
- Actively maintained
- Archived if inactive
- Graduated to a standalone repository under LibreMinds when maturity and interest justify it

## Code Ownership and Stewardship

LibreMinds Labs is a community-driven open-source initiative.

By contributing code, documentation, or other materials to this repository, contributors agree that their contributions become part of the LibreMinds community codebase and are governed by the project’s open-source license.

Once accepted, contributions cannot be withdrawn or claimed as exclusive personal property. No individual contributor retains special ownership, control, or veto rights over contributed work.

LibreMinds acts as a neutral steward of the codebase on behalf of the community. This stewardship may, in the future, be transferred to a non-profit foundation or similar neutral entity without requiring re-approval from individual contributors, while continuing to honor the original open-source license.

This model ensures continuity, fairness, and long-term sustainability for the community and its projects.
